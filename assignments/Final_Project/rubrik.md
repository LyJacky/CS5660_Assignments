# Rubrik (60 points)

We are not looking to see if you succeeded or failed at accomplishing what you set out to do. It’s ok if your results are not “good”. What matters is that you put in a reasonable effort, understand the project and how it related to NLP in detail, and are able to clearly communicate that understanding. Note that you must justify your design, implementation, and experimentation decisions using your knowledge and data. You should make claims about why you think the results turned out the way they did, and perform specific experimentation or gather relevant data to justify it.

A list of questions for evaluating research projects. We’ve adapted that list for our rubrik. **Introduction / Background / Motivation**:

- (5 points) What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
- (5 points) How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- (5 points) Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
Data
- (5 points) What data did you use? Provide details about your data, specifically choose the most important aspects of your data mentioned [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010). You don’t have to choose all of them, just the most relevant.

**Approach:**

- (10 points) What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is anything new in your approach?
- (5 points) What problems did you anticipate? What problems did you encounter? Did the very first thing you tried work? Experiments and Results:
- (10 points) How did you measure success? What experiments were used? What were the results, both quantitative and qualitative? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why? Justify your reasons with arguments supported by evidence and data.

**In addition, 15 more points will be distributed based on:**

- (5 points) Appropriate use of figures / tables / visualizations. Are the ideas presented with appropriate illustration? Are the results presented clearly; are the important differences illustrated?
- (5 points) Overall clarity. Is the manuscript self-contained? Can a peer who has also taken Deep Learning understand all of the points addressed above? Is sufficient detail provided?
- (5 points) Finally, points will be distributed based on your understanding of how your project relates to Deep Learning. Here are some questions to think about:

  - What was the structure of your problem? How did the structure of your model reflect the structure of your problem?
  - What parts of your model had learned parameters (e.g., convolution layers) and what parts did not (e.g., post-processing classifier probabilities into decisions)?
  - What representations of input and output did the neural network expect? How was the data pre/post-processed?
  - What was the loss function?
  - Did the model overfit? How well did the approach generalize?
  - What hyperparameters did the model have? How were they chosen? How did they affect performance? What optimizer was used?
  - What NLP framework did you use?
  - What existing code or models did you start with and what did those starting points provide?

- At least some of these questions and others should be relevant to your project and should be addressed in the PDF. You do not need to address all of them in full detail. Some may be irrelevant to your project and others may be standard and thus require only a brief mention. For example, it is sufficient to simply mention the cross-entropy loss was used and not provide a full description of what that is. Generally, provide enough detail that someone with an appropriate background (in both NLP and your domain of choice) could replicate the main parts of your project somewhat accurately, probably missing a few less important details.

Submit the final report by uploading to “Final Project” assignment on Canvas. There will be a group assignment corresponding to the project submission. Every group should submit the report once and all group member names should be listed through the canvas interface. The supplementary material should also be uploaded as zip file to the Final Project (Supplementary Material) assignment.
